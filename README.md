## Short guide for running

Before reading further, make sure you have a copy of OTClient.

Warning: OTClient precompiled binaries may not be up-to-date (They're not updated frequently)!
So some of the new features may not work at all.

Place the OTClient executable in the root directory of your forgottenmapeditor copy then run the executable.
